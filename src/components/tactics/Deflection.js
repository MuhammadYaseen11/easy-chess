            <strong>Deflection</strong> is a tactical theme in chess that targets a key defending piece, forcing it to leave its post. This can expose an enemy king to check, allow for a capture of material, or create other weaknesses in the opponent's position.

          <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mt-4">
            The tactic is typically executed by attacking a crucial piece that is defending another essential piece or area on the board. The defender is forced to move, which leads to the subsequent fallouts such as loss of material, a mating net, or a crucial pawn breakthrough.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mt-4">
            A classic example of deflection is attacking a piece that defends an entry square or a piece that guards a key attacking piece, thereby weakening the opponentâ€™s position strategically. Understanding and applying deflection can often lead to decisive gains in a game, turning a balanced situation into a winning one.
